# Official-Krunker.io-Client
The Krunker client is an installable, desktop-based version of Krunker.io for Windows, Apple Mac and Linux computers. It allows users to run and play Krunker outside of their browser, as long as your system can run Krunker through the browser, you should expect the client to do the same.  An internet connection is a requirement to run and play in the Krunker.io client.
